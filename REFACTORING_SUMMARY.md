# Refactoring Summary: Auto-Generate Multiple Templates

## Overview
The app has been refactored to automatically generate multiple finished templates instead of asking users to pick options in Slack. Users now receive multiple template variations and can download any of them.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Removed User Selection Flow**
- **Before**: User sends command → App shows options → User picks one → App creates single template
- **After**: User sends command → App automatically generates multiple templates → User can download any

### 2. **New Functions Added**

#### `generateMultipleTemplates(request)`
- Automatically generates 3-5 template variations
- Uses different main images from different chunks for variety
- Creates each template with different backgrounds and supporting graphics
- Uploads each template for download

#### `sendMultipleTemplatesMessage(channelId, blogTitle, templateResults)`
- Sends a rich Slack message with all generated templates
- Shows each template as an image with download link
- Uses Slack blocks for better presentation

### 3. **Removed Functions**
- `showGraphicOptions()` - No longer needed since we don't show options
- `createTemplateDirectly()` - Replaced by `generateMultipleTemplates()`
- `sendSlackMessageWithButtons()` - No longer using interactive buttons
- `showMainImageSelection()` (UI) - Removed selection UI

### 4. **Updated API Endpoints**

#### `api/slack-webhook.js`
- Removed interactive message handling for button clicks
- Simplified to only handle `@figma create` and `@figma reset` commands

#### `api/check-requests.js`
- Removed `waiting_for_selection` status references
- Simplified pending request filtering

### 5. **Updated UI (ui.html)**
- Removed main image selection interface
- Removed `main-image-picks` and `main-image-selected` message handling
- Simplified to only handle single template generation for direct plugin use

### 6. **Updated Main Code (code.js)**
- Modified `processSlackRequest()` to call `generateMultipleTemplates()`
- Removed all selection-related status checks
- Updated `checkForSlackRequests()` to only process `pending` status

## New User Experience

### Slack Flow
1. User types: `@figma create "My Blog Title"`
2. App automatically generates 3-5 template variations
3. App sends Slack message with all templates as images
4. Each template has a download link
5. User can download any template they prefer

### Benefits
- **Faster**: No waiting for user selection
- **More Options**: Users get multiple variations automatically
- **Better UX**: Users can see all options at once and pick their favorite
- **Simpler**: No interactive buttons or complex selection flows

## Technical Details

### Template Generation Strategy
- Uses `getTopPickFromEveryChunk()` to get diverse main images
- Limits to maximum 5 variations for performance
- Each variation uses different backgrounds and supporting graphics
- Adds 500ms delay between generations to prevent overload

### Slack Message Format
- Uses Slack blocks for rich formatting
- Shows each template as an image with metadata
- Includes download links for each variation
- Provides helpful tips for users

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of failed template generations
- Continues processing even if some templates fail
- Sends appropriate error messages to Slack

## Backward Compatibility
- Direct plugin usage (via UI) still works for single template generation
- All existing API endpoints remain functional
- No breaking changes to the core template creation logic

## Performance Considerations
- Multiple template generation takes longer than single template
- Added delays between generations to prevent system overload
- Limited to 5 variations maximum to balance quality and speed
- Templates are generated sequentially to avoid resource conflicts
